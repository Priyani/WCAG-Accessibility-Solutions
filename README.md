============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grimley517/WCAG-Accessibility-Solutions.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/grimley517/WCAG-Accessibility-Solutions)

So far includes a contrast ratio checker that works with hex values from css files, and a fleisch kincaid reading grade checker.  
Test notes
The google sheets document here contains my base calculations.  I think improving the syllable recognition algorithm will improve the accuracy of the result.
